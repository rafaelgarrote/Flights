    * A Ghost Flight is each flight that has arrTime = -1 (that means that the flight didn't land where was supposed to

    * The correct assign to those flights will be :
    *
    * The ghost's flight arrTime would take the data of the nearest flight in time that has its flightNumber and which
    * deptTime is lesser than the ghost's flight deptTime plus a configurable amount of seconds, from here we will call
    * this flight: the saneated Flight
    *
    * So if there is no sanitized Flight for a ghost Flight we will return the same ghost Flight but if there are some
    * sanitized Flight we had to assign the following values to the ghost flight:
    *
    * dest = sanitized Flight origin
    * arrTime = sanitized Flight depTime
    * csrArrTime = sanitized Flight csrDepTime
    * date =  sanitized Flight date

    *   window time = 600 (10 minutes)

    *   flight4 = flightNumber=2, departureTime=1-1-2015 deparHour810 arrTime=-1 orig=A dest=D
