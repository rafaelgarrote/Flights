# Flights

This project will include some Spark simple exercises based in the [airline datashet](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~sguha/rhipe/doc/html/airline.html).

## File format.

The input format used in the exercicies will be a extract for the Flights Dataset.

The file will be separated by commas and each line will have the following structure:

| Field Name        | Description                                                                                                         | Field Type          |
